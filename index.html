          <a href="https://grabcad.com/print">GrabCAD Print</a>: The primary
          user interface for all Stratasys 3D printers including FDM & PolyJet.
          It handles CAD model slicing & print preparation locally, and enables
          remote job scheduling, queue management, and reporting tools for
          networked printers. It's built on Electron + React + TypeScript, with
          a plugin-based, dependency-injection architecture, and is auto-updated
          on a monthly release cycle.

            Improved app-wide UX consistency, maintainability, and increased

            Increased user value with addition & refinement of numerous core

            Improved unit, integration, and diagnostic test quality, coverage,

            Freed up developer resources by automating previously manual,

          <b>Print Scheduler:</b> Led the execution of a greenfield project to
          replace the legacy 3D Printer queue management system with a hybrid
          on-prem/cloud system integrating networked Printers connected locally,
          via legacy cloud infrastructure, or new AWS Greengrass IoT Gateways.
          The system needed to integrate with existing workflows, while allowing
          customers to seamlessly upgrade and unlock new features such as moving
          Jobs between Printers, automatic load balancing, robust audit trails,
          search, and reprint. It was designed from the ground up to be
          functional in fully offline environments, supporting the security
          requirements of government and defense customers.

            plan to a low-risk, incremental approach and delivered with zero
