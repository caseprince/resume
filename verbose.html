          <a href="https://grabcad.com/print">GrabCAD Print</a>: The primary
          user interface for all Stratasys 3D printers including FDM & PolyJet.
          It handles CAD model slicing & print preparation locally, and enables
          remote job scheduling, queue management, and reporting tools for
          networked printers. It's built on Electron + React + TypeScript, with
          a plugin-based, dependency-injection architecture, and is auto-updated
          on a monthly release cycle.

            Improved app-wide UX consistency, maintainability, and increased
            developer velocity by introducing UI Component Library.
          </dd>
          <dd>
            Increased user value with addition & refinement of numerous core
            features including: Project Panel, Main Toolbar, Printer List,
            Preferences Modal, drag-and-drop files, recent files, auto-update.
          </dd>
          <dd>
            Improved unit, integration, and diagnostic test quality, coverage,
            and tooling. Ensured installer integrity with automated end-to-end
            tests using virtual machines in the cloud.
          </dd>
          <dd>
            Freed up developer resources by automating previously manual,
            error-prone installer build, signing, deployment, and release
            processes to the point where the QA organization could take full
            ownership.

          <b>Print Scheduler:</b> A major feature of GrabCAD Print is the
          ability to remotely schedule and manage print jobs on networked
          printers. I led the design and development of the new Print Scheduler,
          which was a ground-up rewrite to replace the legacy 3D printer queue
          management system with a hybrid on‑premises/cloud system integrating
          networked printers connected locally, via legacy cloud infrastructure,
          or new AWS Greengrass IoT Gateways. The system needed to integrate
          with existing workflows, while allowing customers to seamlessly
          upgrade and unlock new features such as moving jobs between printers,
          automatic load balancing, robust audit trails, search, and reprint. It
          was designed from the ground up to be functional in fully offline
          environments, supporting the security requirements of government and
          defense customers.

            Completion of stalled multi-year effort to replace legacy auth
            system with AWS Cognito for 100K+ users. I completed this project as
            half of a 2 dev "tiger team". We pivoted from a high-risk rollout
            plan to a low-risk, incremental approach and delivered with zero
            downtime and no regressions.

          was a best-of-breed Application Performance Management (APM) SaaS
          application. As a member of TraceView's Web App team, I collaborated
          with product managers, designers, and distributed developer teams to
          design, develop, and deliver new features and visualizations,
          including the

          We also fixed copious bugs, eradicated technical debt, refactored

          libraries, and tooling.

          TraceView was acquired by SolarWinds and rebranded as

          strategic asset.
